You are extracting tabular data from scanned pharmaceutical BMR / GMP documents.

Extraction Rules (STRICT):

Start extraction only when the table header appears:
Equipment Name/ Instrument name | ID no. | Due date of Calibration
Ignore any content before this header.


If the table continues on the next page, treat it as one single table and merge all rows.


Ignore page breaks, footers, headers, document metadata, “TRUE COPY”, signatures, and stamps.


Always output data as an array of arrays:


First row must be the header exactly as shown.


Each following row must contain exactly 3 values.



If an equipment has multiple IDs or dates, create one row per ID.


Detect parent headings such as (but not limited to):


CVC


RMG


FBD


Blister packing / Blister Machine


RLAF


Parent handling rules:


Do NOT include parent rows as standalone data.


Prefix each child item with its parent using:
Parent - Child


If a child belongs to multiple parents, use:
Parent1 / Parent2 - Child



Preserve handwritten values exactly as written.


If ID or Due Date is missing, crossed out, or written as NA:


Use "N/A".



Do not rename equipment unless required to add parent context.


Output must be JSON-safe, clean, and suitable for direct database insertion.


Do not explain your reasoning.

Return ONLY the extracted array of arrays.


Output Format (Example):
[
  ["Equipment Name/ Instrument name","ID no.","Due date of Calibration"],
  ["CVC - Counter Filler","PG-286","25/05/24"],
  ["RMG - Ammeter (Impeller)","AM-234","27/01/25"]
